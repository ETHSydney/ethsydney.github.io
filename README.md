## Membership

Got to the [SydEthereum](https://www.meetup.com/sydeth) group on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) to become a member of SydEthereum.

## Upcoming Events

The monthly SydEthereum events are typically run in the evening of the last Thursday of each month. See the [events page](https://www.meetup.com/sydeth/events/) for more details.

## Telegram

It wouldn't be Blockchain without a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) chat group. A lot of the SydEthereum members are in [Ethereum Australia](https://t.me/joinchat/Ay6EdUKjkX5TtlgPQ12vEA) but it is not exclusive to Sydney. There are Ethereans from around Australia and overseas in the Ethereum Australia group.
