## Membership

Go to the [ETHSydney](https://www.meetup.com/ethsydney) group on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) to become a member of ETHSydney.

## Upcoming Events

The monthly ETHSydney events are typically run in the evening of the last Thursday of each month. See the [events page](https://www.meetup.com/sydeth/events/) for more details.

## Telegram

It wouldn't be Blockchain without a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) chat group. A lot of the ETHSydney members are in the [Ethereum Australia](https://t.me/joinchat/Ay6EdUKjkX5TtlgPQ12vEA) group but it is not exclusive to Sydney. There are Ethereans from around Australia and overseas in the Ethereum Australia group.
