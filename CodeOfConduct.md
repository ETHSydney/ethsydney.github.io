# Code of conduct

## Scope

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetup are required to comply with the following code of conduct. If you do not wish to comply, you should reconsider attending our events.

## Policy

Be excellent to each other.

Our goal is to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Language or imagery which belittles individuals based on personal characteristics protected under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 is prohibited.

Our meetups are safe environments for the expression of personal work and ideas. Participants are required to provide feedback in a positive manner. Ridicule, bullying or personal embarrassment will not be tolerated.
Meetup participants violating these rules will be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup or event at the discretion of the meetup organisers.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a meetup organizer.
